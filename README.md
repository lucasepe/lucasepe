I'm a pragmatic toolsmith who enjoys crafting command-line tools 
and hacking on ideas that make life easier for developers and everyday users.

> I believe in simplicity, composability, and doing less but better.

## 🔍 Interests & Principles

- Build tools that **do one thing well**
- Automate the tedious, **expose the essential**
- Prefer terminal over GUI, and **plain text over magic**
- Passionate about Go, shell, and developer experience
